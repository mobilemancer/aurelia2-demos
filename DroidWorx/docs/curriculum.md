# Creating a new Aurelia 2 project

The easiest way is to use npx and run

```npx au2 new```

This will help scaffold a new project, setting up preffered project structure, using TypeScript or JavaScript. Additional choise of CSS preprocessors, testign frameworks etc.

# Startup main.ts

The entry point for the entire project is ```main.ts```. This is a good place to register things in the DI container.

# DI

Dependency Injection was a very good part of Aurelia. In Aurelia 2 it has an even more prolific role, but with a simpler and more usable interface.

# Custom Components

Components are the main building blocks of Aurelia apps.

# Data Binding

Aurelia's reactive databinding is at the same time simple and very powerfull.

# Global Registrations

To not be forced to import/require components in views all the time, globaly registering components can be a good alternative. 

# Template Repeaters

for.of

# Template Conditionals

if.bind

# Router

The new router is able to handle routing without route configurations.

# Independent ViewPorts

The possibility of independent navigation in different viewports enables us to start using routing and viewports as design elements.

# Value Converters

Value Converters are excellent tools for bending values to comply with our needs for presentation. Text in, text out.
